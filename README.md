# Abiel.Code.Dev-JS

This website was created so that I can test my knowledge in JavaScript. I started to notice that what I was learning with my mentor was not stickings so I decided to make a website that show cases my understanding of JavaScript in my own words. In each page there is a chapter and in each chapter there are sections with there notes and example code.
